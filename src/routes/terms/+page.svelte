	<div class="flex flex-col gap-2.5" id="service-termination">
		<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Service Termination</h2>
		<p>
			By using Titanium, you agree that we have the right to terminate your service at any time,
			with or without notice, for any reason. When this happens, you will not be allowed to run any
			commands with Titanium, use Titanium context menu items, or interact with Titanium in any
			other way. We will do this one of two ways:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				<span class="font-bold">Per User Termination:</span> if one user is violating the terms of service,
				we will blacklist the user from accessing Titanium's services.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="font-bold">Server Termination:</span> if an entire Discord server is violating the
				terms of service, we will blacklist the server from being able to use Titanium's services. The
				bot will be kicked from the server and will automatically leave if someone attempts to add it
				back.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This info will not be shared with anyone not in the dev team. We are currently working on a
			way to opt out of this error collection and will have more information to share about this at
			a later time.
		</p>
